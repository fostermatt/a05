Do a detailed write-up of the design of your program (e.g. how did you detect when an element failed to insert), problems encountered in design and implementation, and your choice of options (e.g. why did you pick the hash function that you did, why did you pick the probing functions that you did).

Lastly, do some test runs on data sets and command line options of your own design. Discuss the results and explain why some are better or worse than others.

Summarize what you feel are "best" options are based on your tests. Best is subjective and can variously refer to speed, lowering collisions, reducing rehashing, lowering failures, etc.
