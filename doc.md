###Assignment 5 - Documentation###
#####What the program does#####  
This program will read integers from a data file and attempt to insert them into a hash table. 

#####Limitations#####  
The character limit depends on the system running this program, but in testing should greatly exceed 4 billion characters.  
This program will only work with integers, floats and doubles may not be used. The maximum and minimum values of each integer (input and resulting answers) are determined by the system as well. Based on the C++ documentation the values supported should be from -32767 (-2^15 + 1) to 32767 (2^15 - 1).

#####Operation#####  
Command line operation execution as follows:  

	$ ./<executable.name> <data.file>  <probing option> <load factor>

The data file must  

Once executed the program will output the given expression followed by what it evaluates to or an error message and short message explaining the error.
